general:

	proved:
		partition problem reduces to gasoline problem
		3-partition problem reduces to gasoline problem
		OPT is not bounded by max fuel or max distance
		there is a 2*OPT approximation algorithm (Newman, RÃ¶glin, Seif)

local search:
	based on some potential function p, improve current solution as much as possible
	consider as neighbors any solution which is generated by swapping two fuels
	
	proved:
		max(w)-min(w) as potential function is O(n)*OPT
		max2 as potential function O(n)*OPT
		softmax as potential with s = w-min(w) is O(n)*OPT
		softmax with only positive solutions is equivalent to softmax with s = w-min(w)
		there are not always good swaps between 0 and OPT when current solution is bad
		
	questions:
		is softmax with s = abs(w) near OPT?
		if softmax with s = abs(w-avg(max(w),min(w))) near OPT?
		what happens if we consider any two swaps of a solution as a neighbor?
		does local search terminate after polynomial iterations?
		
linear program:

	proved:
		integrality gap is O(n)

greedy algorithm:
	pick the largest tank which does not cause fuel to exceed 2*OPT

	proved:
		if all fuels are either 0 or f*, greedy is optimal
		if all fuels are either f or F, greedy is optimal
		if we can select multiple or no fuels, greedy is 2*optimal
		if fuels are a permutation of distances, greedy is optimal
		in the general case, greedy is O(n)*OPT

	questions:
		if fuels are a permutation of distances and the start is fixed, is greedy optimal?

min over opt algorithm:
	pick the smallest tank which will stay over OPT, or the largest tank if none will

	proved:
		if all fuels are either 0 or f*, min over opt is 2*optimal
		if we can select multiple fuels or no fuels, min over opt is 2*optimal
		if fuels are a permutation of distances, min over opt is optimal
		in general case, min over opt is O(n)*OPT
