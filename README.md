This repository is comprised of various algorithms and test cases which attempt to find an approximate solution to the gasoline problem. I use it to test some algorithms or some ideas I have about this problem. 

The gasoline problem is NP-hard, therefore none of the algorithms in this repository attempt to find an optimal solution.
